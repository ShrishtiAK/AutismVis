                <b>NSCH (National Survey for Children's Health)</b> data for 2016 shows that around 1.5 million children
                (ages 3-17) had autism in the year 2016. Based on this and other data, the estimated
                number of adults (ages 18-84) with autism is over 5.4 million in the year 2017.

                geographical
